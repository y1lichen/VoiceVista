VoiceVista is licensed under the MIT License to continue providing the service to blind and vision impaired community.\nVoiceVista helps you stay aware of where you are and where you're going by using unique audio guidance and by calling out roads, intersections, and places as you approach them.\nVoiceVista uses 3D sound to let you know what's around you. For example, if your destination is on your right,you will hear sound coming from that direction, or if a coffee shop is on your left, you will hear a callout from that direction.\nPlace an beacon on your destination and VoiceVista will keep you informed of its location and your surroundings along the way. Use VoiceVista in conjunction with your wayfinding skills and even your favorite navigation app to find your way to your destination.\nPut away the phone and walk. VoiceVista will help you stay aware of where you are by calling out roads, intersections, and landmarks as you approach them. Callouts can be adjusted in the settings.\nHold the phone flat in your hand, and use the buttons to locate roads and upcoming intersections, orient to familiar landmarks around you, and explore landmarks ahead of you.";

Furthermore, VoiceVista's value to you may evolve over time so how you use it today may differ from how you will use it in three months.\nPeople often think about apps in terms of 'what problem is this app good at solving?' VoiceVista certainly can be used on a case by case basis when you have a specific information need – such as keeping track of a destination as you make your way there, helping to orient yourself when you emerge from a metro station, getting your bearings when exiting a car, or finding the street names for, or distance to, the next intersection.\nHowever, the philosophy behind VoiceVista is one of 'lighting up your world with sound', designed to be used anytime you are out and about to provide ambient awareness of your surroundings, such as keeping you aware of the names of the streets you are on, the direction you are heading, and the names of businesses you are passing.";

This acts like a compass telling the app which direction you are facing.\nDouble tap the What's My Location button quickly gives you information that helps you figure out where you currently are. It tells you about your current location including things like the direction you are facing, where nearby roads or intersections are, and where nearby points of interest are.\nSwiping down on What's My Location button allows you to either save your current location as a marker or share your current location.\nDouble tap the What's Around Me button tells you about one thing in each of the four quadrants around you (ahead, to the right, behind, and to the left).\nSwiping down on What's Around Me button will give you options to hear markers or list places which are near by. The Nearby Markers action tells you about up to four markers that are closest to you. When you are trying to get your bearings and orient yourself to your surroundings, use Nearby Places to list about the locations of places you know of.\nDouble tap the What's Ahead of Me button tells you about four things ahead of you.

First, view the details for a location by either using the search bar to search for a place, or tapping one of the 'Places Nearby', or 'Markers', and selecting a location.\nFrom the location details screen you can select the 'Start Beacon' button. Tapping this will return you to the home screen and turn on a beacon coming from the direction of the place you selected. The name of the place you have selected along with its distance and physical address, if available, will now be displayed on the main app screen.\nSetting a beacon on a nearby location allows VoiceVista to keep you informed by playing a beacon sound coming from the direction of that location. This beacon can be muted or unmuted on the home screen. Additionally, VoiceVista displays information about the location on the home screen including the distance to it and its street address if it is known.\nSetting a beacon is useful when you want to keep track of a familiar landmark as you explore a new area or when you are going somewhere and want to be informed about your surroundings along the way. The beacon feature gives you a continuous audible sound that tells you the direction to the beacon, relative to where you are currently located. Using the beacon, your existing wayfinding skills, and even your favourite navigation app, you can choose how you want to get to nearby locations yourself.\nTo remove the current beacon, simply press the 'Remove Beacon' button on the home screen.\nTo mute the beacon, tap the 'Mute Beacon' button underneath the 'Remove Beacon' button on the home screen.";

"faq.q.6" = "How do I use a beacon like a pro?";
"faq.a.6" = "You can think of the beacon as a 'lighthouse for the ears', notifying you of where your destination is relative to your location, as the crow flies.\nLike a lighthouse, it does not tell you how to get there – you may need to make many navigation choices along the way, just as a sailboat will have to make many strategic 'tacks' to get closer to the lighthouse.\nThe continuous rhythmic sound of the beacon is spatialised from the direction of the destination, and helps you stay aware of the location of the destination relative to you as you walk.\nWhen you are walking directly toward the destination, or you point the phone toward the destination, a higher pitched 'ring' sound will be heard.\nThis feature allows you to pinpoint the direction of the destination since the direction of the rhythmic sound can sometimes be difficult to perceive in loud environments. When searching for the higher pitched 'ring', hold the phone flat and sweep the phone slowly; turning your head to point in the same direction of the phone will ensure that you have the best spatial audio experience.\nThe lighthouse metaphor for the beacon's design has several natural implications:\n1. There is no 'correct' direction to travel when using the beacon, instead, with VoiceVista you choose how to get there;\n2. The higher pitched 'ring' helps you pinpoint the direction of the destination only – it is not an indication of how you should get there;\n3. If you generally know how to get to your destination, you may wish to mute the beacon for the majority of your trip and turn it on only as you get closer to your destination.";

"faq.q.7" = "Why does the beacon disappear sometimes?";
"faq.a.7" = "VoiceVista's beacon is fundamentally a directional cue, telling you where your destination is relative to the direction you are facing. When VoiceVista is uncertain about what direction you are facing, it lowers the volume of the beacon.\nMost often this occurs if you have been walking with the phone stored in a pocket or bag, and you stop moving, such as to cross a street. The beacon will get louder once you start moving again, or if you hold the phone flat and point it in the direction you are facing.";

"faq.q.8" = "Can I set a beacon on an address?";

"faq.a.11" = "Yes, you can turn the beacon back on once VoiceVista turns it off by selecting the 'unmute beacon button'; however, since Location Services is only accurate to about 10 metres, we cannot guarantee the behaviour of the beacon when you are within a few metres of your destination. ";

"faq.q.12" = "Why does VoiceVista call out road names twice when I approach an intersection?";
"faq.a.12" = "To accommodate a variety of intersection configurations, VoiceVista describes intersections as segments of roadways that depart from a common point.\nVoiceVista uses spatial audio to indicate the name of the road that goes to the left, the name of the road that continues straight ahead, and the name of the road that goes to the right, in that order.\nIf the description of the intersection begins with the road you are on rather than one to the left, then the intersection is a T with the road you are on continuing ahead and a road intersecting from the right.\nSimilarly, if the description only includes a road to the left and to the right, you will know that the road you are on ends at a T ahead of you.

Select the 'unmute beacon button' on the main screen to resume hearing the beacon.\n2. Stop automatic callouts: When you are not travelling or have reached a destination, you probably will not need VoiceVista to continue to notify you of things around you. Instead of exiting the app, you can put VoiceVista in to Snooze mode and it will wake up again when you leave, or you can put VoiceVista into Sleep mode and it will stay off until you choose to turn it back on. Alternatively, you can select 'Settings' from the tabs and choose to turn all callouts off in the `Callouts Setting'.\n3. Stop the beacon: There are several scenarios for which you might set a destination, but not need the beacon on. For example, you may know exactly how to get to your destination but want to get automatic updates about how far away you are from your destination. Or, you may know roughly how to get to your destination, and only need the beacon as you near your destination.

Select Settings tab, then Voice to adjust the Speaking Rate and Voice settings. Additional voices and enhanced voices with a higher quality can be downloaded in the iOS Settings app at Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices.\n2. Distance Metric: VoiceVista allows you to hear all distances in either feet or metres. Open settings tab, change the option of 'Unit of Measure' in 'General Settings' page.\n3. Markers: You can mark your world with anything you care about. You can mark things that are personal and relevant to you like your home, your office and your preferred grocery store. Then VoiceVista will automatically call out marked places as you walk by or approach them, or you can also use the Nearby Markers button at the VoiceVista home screen to hear a spatial callout of marked places around you. These markers will remain personal to you and will not be available to anyone else.\n4. Callouts: VoiceVista can tell you about things around you as you approach them by calling out their name from the direction they are located in. The app will do this automatically for all sorts of things like businesses, bus stops, and even intersections. You can configure what the app automatically calls out in the 'Callouts Settings' page of the 'Settings' screen, and you can turn all callouts off when you want the app to be silent.\nIn addition to the above, the following VoiceOver settings can influence how VoiceVista behaves:\n1. VoiceOver Tips: When VoiceOver tips are turned ON, you will hear more information about all the buttons on the primary VoiceVista screen. You can turn on VoiceOver tips by navigating to the iOS Settings app and going to Accessibility > VoiceOver > Verbosity, and turning the Speak Hints setting on.\n2. Audio Ducking: VoiceVista is designed to work with Audio Ducking turned OFF. When Audio Ducking is on, automatic callouts can be difficult to hear if VoiceOver is used simultaneously. We recommend turning Audio Ducking off to make it easier to hear all automatic callouts that occur as you are interacting with the phone. Audio ducking can be turned off in VoiceOver settings or via the VoiceOver rotor.\n3. Touch ID or Face ID to Unlock: Setting your phone to unlock using Touch ID or Face ID will make unlocking the phone fast and easy, and in turn, allow you to access the My Location, Around Me, and Ahead of Me buttons as quickly as possible when you are on the go.
